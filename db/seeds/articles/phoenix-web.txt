Phoenix (Elixir Web Framework)
Phoenix is a web development framework written in Elixir which implements the server-side MVC pattern. If you've ever used a similar framework, say Ruby on Rails or Python's Django, many of the concepts will be familiar to you. Phoenix gives you the best of both worlds, high developer productivity and high application performance. It also has some interesting new twists, channels for managing realtime events, pre-compiled templates and the potential for alternative architectures which may make services more manageable from the very beginning of your project.
