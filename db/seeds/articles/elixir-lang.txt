Elixir
Elixir is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). Elixir builds on top of Erlang and shares the same abstractions for building distributed, fault-tolerant applications. Elixir also provides a productive tooling and an extensible design. The latter is supported by compile-time metaprogramming with macros and polymorphism via protocols.
Elixir is successfully used in the industry by companies such as Pinterest and Moz. Elixir is also used for web development, by companies such as Bleacher Report and Inverse, and for building embedded-systems. The community organizes yearly events in both United States and Europe as well as minor local events and conferences.
